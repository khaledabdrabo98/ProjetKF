# ProjetKF 

The project's goal was to create a software animating a 3D mesh with live recorded facial expressions.

### Tech

This project uses a number of tools to work properly :

* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) - Image processing library.
* [gKit2light](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/jean-claude.iehl/Public/educ/M1IMAGE/html/index.html) - OpenGL code base 
* [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) - Multi-purpose library, used in this project for its facial recognition algorithms.
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - Window management.
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Great library to integrate interfaces into real-time applications.

### Installation

You'll need to install the following tools on a linux machine for it to work properly :
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).
* OpenGL.
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).

To build the project :

```sh
$ cd src/build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Then run it : 

```sh
$ ./lifprojet_am4
```
